### Maxime

Here you can find some of my projects, mainly done while being a student in Mathematics & Finance.

A bit about myself : competitive and hard-working by nature, addicted to improving and writing clean code. <br>
Probably watching Chuck for the 10-th time while ðŸ’»

I am passionate about designing the best structures to take the most out of a program.
